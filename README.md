This is a line for line conversion from one of the many 70â€™s BASIC version of Star Trek into JavaScript.

I love finding projects I am passionate about.
A friend was showing off all his Star Trek games which reminded me of one of the very first computer Star Trek games.  I remember playing it on the PET computer. It was written in BASIC.

I was surprised to discover almost no (good) ports of the code to JavaScript. JavaScript would allow it to run on any pc.

I heard a voice in my head say, 'Thou shalt do this'.

This is a faithful conversion of a StarTrek BASIC program from the early 70's into JavaScript. (Disclaimer: I made the universe closed, so you can't fly out of the 8x8 quadrants. Sue me.)
Yes, it could have been rewritten from scratch, but I wanted to be as faithful to the original as possible

Challenges:

BASIC pauses at INPUT command. It awaits user input then continues.
JavaScript cannot pause.
The DOM can only update when the code has completed.
Input can only come from a text box event, which starts the JS running code again.

To simulate / mimic the BASIC INPUT command, we end our code in JS just before the BASIC input code while also setting a 'nextLine' variable. var 'nextLine' indicates where the code should resume after a user input event
nextLine = 1270; return; (or equivalent) accomplishes this
A user input event will store the user input in a variable 'globalComandStorage'. Then we call the function switch_board() which looks at nextLine and then calls function Line'nextLine'()
Code runs again until we require user input

The BASIC GOTO command is a menace. It makes it easy to write poorly structured code.
In some cases, I just restructured the code, in others, I did not.
GOTO can be simulated with something similar to GOTO6543(); return;
Eventually we will come to an INPUT command.
As stated before, to simulate INPUT, we return from and stop all JS code.
If there is a big call stack, because of our many GOTOXXXX calls,
all the return; commands placed after our GOTOXXXX calls will clean the call stack

I soon needed to create multidimensional arrays. Basic uses a simple G= DIM[7,9,3] format creating an array called G, with dimensions of 7x9x3. JavaScript, oddly enough, does not have an easy, built in, way to create an array like BASIC. So I had to code a JavaScript version of DIM using a recursive function.
